Welcome to the College Nexus Workshop! This repository contains all materials for the workshop organized into week-wise folders. Each week has a dedicated folder containing a README file, assignments, and class codes.

## Repository Structure

- **Week-wise folders (`week1`, `week2`, etc.)**: Each folder corresponds to a workshop week and contains:
  - `README.md`: Overview of the week, topics covered, and learning objectives.
  - **assignment**: Folder with assignment materials for the week.
  - **class**: Folder with code samples, demonstrations, and other materials used in class sessions.

## Navigating the Workshop Materials

2. **Assignment**: Complete assignments provided in each week’s `assignment` folder to reinforce learning.
